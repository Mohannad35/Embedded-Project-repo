go to port_PBcfg.c and change the struct for the desired pin with the configuration u want.

The default configuration as follow:
	1. The port number for each channel = (0,1,2,3,4,5 -> A,B,C,D,E,F in order)
	2. The pin number for each channel = (from 0 -> 8)
	3. The channel direction = (input)
	4. The channel mode = (DIO digital input output pin)
	5. The internal resistor = (OFF)
	6. The initial value = (STD_LOW)
	7. The pin direction changeable during runing time or not = (STD_OFF)
	8. The pin mode changeable during runing time or not = (STD_OFF)

{
	Port_number,
	Pin_number,
	Direction,
	Mode,
	Internal_resistor,
	Initial_value,
	Direction_changable,
	Mode_changable
}

ex: this is configuration for pin A0
const Port_ConfigChannel Port_Configurations_PA0 = {
	PORT_A,
	PIN_0,
	PORT_PIN_IN,
	PORT_DIO_MODE,
	RESISTOR_OFF,
	STD_LOW,
	STD_OFF,
	STD_OFF};
